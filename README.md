Overview:

The GEN AI-Based Virtual Assistant for Dental Sciences project is a robust and intelligent system designed to provide precise, context-aware answers to dental health-related queries. This project combines advancements in natural language processing (NLP), vector search, and conversational AI to create a tool capable of delivering accurate and contextually relevant responses to both predefined FAQs and custom user questions.


Objectives:



Enhance Access to Dental Knowledge: Provide users with easy access to expert-level dental information using AI-based systems.

Facilitate Interactive Learning: Enable users to ask specific questions about dental health and receive detailed, relevant answers.

Utilize Generative AI for Contextual Answers: Employ state-of-the-art AI models for embedding creation, similarity search, and conversational responses.

Streamline Query Processing: Integrate FAQs and a user-friendly interface for efficient information retrieval.





Features:

PDF Text Extraction: Automatically extracts text from a provided PDF file.

Text Chunking: Splits extracted text into manageable chunks for processing.

Vector Store Creation: Creates a FAISS-based vector store for efficient similarity search.

Conversational Chain: Uses a custom prompt template to provide accurate and contextual answers to dental-related questions.

FAQ Handling: Includes a predefined set of frequently asked questions for quick responses.

User Interaction: Allows users to input custom questions and get responses.
