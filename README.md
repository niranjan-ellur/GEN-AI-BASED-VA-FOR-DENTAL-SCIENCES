Overview:

The GEN AI-Based Virtual Assistant for Dental Sciences project is a robust and intelligent system designed to provide precise, context-aware answers to dental health-related queries. This project combines advancements in natural language processing (NLP), vector search, and conversational AI to create a tool capable of delivering accurate and contextually relevant responses to both predefined FAQs and custom user questions.


Objectives:



1) Enhance Access to Dental Knowledge: Provide users with easy access to expert-level dental information using AI-based systems.

2) Facilitate Interactive Learning: Enable users to ask specific questions about dental health and receive detailed, relevant answers.

3) Utilize Generative AI for Contextual Answers: Employ state-of-the-art AI models for embedding creation, similarity search, and conversational responses.

4) Streamline Query Processing: Integrate FAQs and a user-friendly interface for efficient information retrieval.





Features:

1) PDF Text Extraction: Automatically extracts text from a provided PDF file.

2) Text Chunking: Splits extracted text into manageable chunks for processing.

3) Vector Store Creation: Creates a FAISS-based vector store for efficient similarity search.

4) Conversational Chain: Uses a custom prompt template to provide accurate and contextual answers to dental-related questions.

5) FAQ Handling: Includes a predefined set of frequently asked questions for quick responses.

6) User Interaction: Allows users to input custom questions and get responses.







Technologies Used:

1) Streamlit: For building an interactive web interface.

2) PyPDF2: For reading and extracting text from PDF files.

3) LangChain: For handling language model interactions and creating conversational chains.

4) Google Generative AI: For embeddings and chat capabilities.

5) FAISS: For efficient vector-based similarity searches.

6) dotenv: For managing environment variables.
